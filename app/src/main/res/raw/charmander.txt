Charmander is a Fire type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. Most of its body is colored orange, while its underbelly is light yellow and it has blue eyes. It has a flame at the end of its tail, which is said to signify its health.

Charmander's design is based on a lizard, however as its name suggests it may also have been inspired by salamanders, which in mythology have an affinity with fire.

Chamander's final evolution form is Charizard. A Fire/Flying Pokémon.
